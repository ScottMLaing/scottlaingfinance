<!--# Intro -->

<p class="topbr">

# Greetings!

I'm Scott Laing. I'm currently an Adjunct Professor at the [University at Buffalo School of Management](https://management.buffalo.edu/) and Finance PhD Candidate (ABD). I've taught a large number of Finance and Economics courses, and have created a Financial Modeling course featured in the MS/MBA Finance program which is a crash course for students into the world of R/RStudio. My research interests lie primarily in Sustainable Investing and ESG Research (Environmental Social Governance) and observing the real impact of Governmental Policy decisions at the firm and environmental level. Additionally I have a strong passion for the Data Science (Data Modeling) communities, including creating free Technical Skills courses on my YouTube Channel.
